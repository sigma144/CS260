		<h2>Some large projects I have completed</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Family Map Android App (Java)</li>
			<p>This Java App was a school project programmed in Android Studio. The app imported family history data from a server
			and displayed the locations of important events in ancestors' lives, along with the ability to search for specific people and events.
			</p>
			<li>SQLite Web Server (Java)</li>
			<p>This project was designed alongside the Family Map app. It stores family history data in a SQLite server and
			provides pieces of data to clients sending requests over the Internet. It also manages user login, registration, and authentication.
			</p>
			<li>Datalog interpreter (C++)</li>
			<p>This project was done early in my CS college career. It was designed it a similar way to Prolog, in that is parses an input file
			for schemes, facts, rules, and queries and uses relational algebra to answer the querues according to the rules and facts.
			</p>
			<li>Dominion (C# MonoGame)</li>
			<p>This is one of many C# MonoGame projects I developed independently. This one specifically implements a single-player
			version of the card game Dominion. The project currently contains bugs, but will be improved upon and expanded after
			my currently required projects and complete.
